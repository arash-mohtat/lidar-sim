path to save .png files from rendered results.
When you clone the repo, you won't see any png files as they are git-ignored.

For lidar pointcloud renderings, we use a variety of formats including
.csv, .xyz (text file with space separated x, y, z columns) and .mlp (XML-like
Meshlab files containing arrangement of xyz files as mesh layers). These files
are also git-ignore as they can be generated by running the scripts, and are neither 
supposed to be version-controlled, nor needed for running the scripts.
